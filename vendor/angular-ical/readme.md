> angular-ical is an Angular factory wrapper for [ical.js](https://github.com/mozilla-comm/ical.js)

`ICAL` doesn't have to be accessed by the `window` object. Use dependency injection instead. Great for unit test and do everything in the Angular manner.

Add `ngIcal` as a module dependency to your app after including the `angular-ical.js` script and inject `ical` anywhere you need.

**NOTE**: the service `ical` is the same object as `window.ICAL`. We prefer camelCase in Angular for objects.
